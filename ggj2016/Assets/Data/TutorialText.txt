Good morning family!

Well rested? Because it's time to go to school or work. 
Everybody has his own morning ritual. Check yours under your portrait.

Complete them and improve your day.
But fail them and you'll follow the consequences...

Dad's work has asked him to wear a tie everyday. 
Time to get that old thing out of the closet this morning!

He might need some help tying it though...

------- 

Bruises and scratches! School has let you know that the kinds tend to fall on their face quite a lot.
They suggested to start with tying their shoe laces in the morning.

But who will teach the kids that?
